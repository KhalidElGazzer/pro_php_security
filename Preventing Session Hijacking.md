## Persistent Sessions in PHP

Persistent sessions were introduced to overcome HTTP's stateless nature, which treats each request and response as independent. As web applications evolved to handle complex transactions (e.g., online shopping), maintaining context across multiple requests became essential. Sessions address this by storing transaction-related data on the server, identified by a unique session ID. This ID is sent to the client after the first request and returned with subsequent requests, allowing the server to retrieve the relevant session data and maintain state across interactions.

## PHP Sessions

PHP provides native support for session management. Key points include:

### Session Initialization
- The `session_start()` function initializes the session engine, generates a session ID (stored in `PHPSESSID`), and creates the `$_SESSION` superglobal array to store session data. This data is saved in a temporary file on the server.

### Session ID Preservation
- **Cookies**: If enabled, a cookie named `PHPSESSID` is created with the session ID.
- **Transparent Session ID**: If cookies are disabled, PHP can append the session ID as a `$_GET` variable to URLs.

### Session ID Retrieval
- When a script calls `session_start()`, it first checks for the `PHPSESSID` in `$_COOKIE`.
- If not found and transparent session IDs are enabled, it checks the URL for the session ID (`https://example.com/?PHPSESSID=123456`).
- If no ID is found, a new one is generated.

### Session Data Access
- The session ID is used to retrieve stored session data, which is loaded into the `$_SESSION` array for use by the script.

### Session Expiry
- Session ID cookies are stored in the browser's memory and expire when the browser is closed.
- The `session.cookie_lifetime` setting in `php.ini` can extend the session ID's validity.

## A Sample Session

This example demonstrates how PHP sessions work to maintain state across multiple scripts, enabling persistent interactions in a stateless HTTP environment.

### Script 1: `sessionDemo1.php`

```php
<?php
session_start();
$test = 'hello ';
$_SESSION['testing'] = 'and hello again';
echo 'This is session ' . session_id() . '<br />';
?>
<br />
<a href="sessionDemo2.php">go to the next script</a>
```

#### What Happens in `sessionDemo1.php`?

1. **Session Initialization:**
    - `session_start()` starts a new session or resumes an existing one.
    - A unique session ID is generated (e.g., `115e0d2357bff343819521ccbce14c8b`).
    - The `$_SESSION` superglobal array is initialized.

2. **Data Storage:**
    - A regular variable `$test` is set to `'hello'`. This variable is not stored in the session and will be lost when the script ends.
    - The value `'and hello again'` is stored in the `$_SESSION['testing']` array. This data is persisted in the session.

3. **Session ID Display:**
    - The session ID is displayed using `session_id()`.

4. **Behind the Scenes:**
    - PHP creates a temporary file on the server (e.g., `sess_115e0d2357bff343819521ccbce14c8b`) to store the session data.
    - A cookie named `PHPSESSID` is sent to the client’s browser with the session ID:
      ```
      PHPSESSID=115e0d2357bff343819521ccbce14c8b
      ```

### Script 2: `sessionDemo2.php`

```php
<?php
session_start();
?>
This is still session <?= session_id() ?><br />
The value of $test is "<?= $test ?>."<br />
The value of $_SESSION['testing'] is "<?= $_SESSION['testing'] ?>."
```

#### What Happens Here?

- `session_start();` resumes the session by checking if a session ID exists.
- `session_id()` confirms that the same session ID is being used.
- `$test` is displayed but has no value because it was not stored in `$_SESSION` (it was just a normal variable in the first script).
- `$_SESSION['testing']` retains its value from `sessionDemo1.php`, proving that the session persists.

#### Behind the Scenes
- PHP retrieves the `PHPSESSID` from the user's cookie.
- The session file on the server is read, restoring the `$_SESSION` data.
- The session ID remains unchanged.
- `$test` does not persist because it was a local variable, not stored in the session.

## Key Takeaways

- Session variables persist across different pages, while normal variables do not.
- The session ID is stored in a cookie (`PHPSESSID`) and used to retrieve stored session data.
- If cookies are disabled, PHP appends the session ID to the URL (`?PHPSESSID=xyz123`).
- Without sessions, maintaining state across pages (e.g., user authentication, shopping carts) would be impossible.

## Abuse of Sessions: Session Hijacking and Session Fixation

PHP sessions are powerful for maintaining state across web applications, but they also introduce security risks if not properly managed. Two primary types of session abuse are **session hijacking** and **session fixation**. Below is a detailed explanation of these threats and how they can be mitigated.

### First: Session Hijacking

Session hijacking occurs when an attacker steals a valid session ID and uses it to impersonate the legitimate user. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as accessing sensitive data or making unauthorized transactions.

#### Methods of Session Hijacking:

1. **Network Eavesdropping:**
    - Attackers can intercept network traffic to capture session IDs.
    - Tools like packet sniffers (e.g., Wireshark) can be used to monitor unencrypted traffic.
    - Wi-Fi networks are particularly vulnerable, as traffic can be intercepted by anyone on the same network.

   **Mitigation:**
    - Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt all communication between the client and server.
    - Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.
    - Use switches instead of hubs in wired networks to isolate traffic.

2. **Unwitting Exposure:**
    - If transparent session IDs are enabled, session IDs may be appended to URLs (e.g., `?PHPSESSID=12345`).
    - Users might inadvertently share these URLs, exposing their session IDs.

   **Mitigation:**
    - Disable `session.use_trans_sid` in `php.ini` to prevent session IDs from being appended to URLs.
    - Set `session.use_only_cookies` to `1` to ensure session IDs are only accepted via cookies.

### Second: Session Fixation

Session fixation is an attack where an attacker forces a user to use a known session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session after the user logs in. This is the opposite of session hijacking, where the attacker steals an existing session ID.

#### How Session Fixation Works

1. **Attacker Sets a Session ID:**
    - The attacker generates or obtains a session ID (e.g., `PHPSESSID=9876`).
    - They repeatedly send requests with this session ID, but these fail because no valid session exists yet.

2. **Attacker Tricks the User:**
    - The attacker sends the user a link containing the fixed session ID, disguised as something harmless (e.g., a picture of a truck).
    - Example link: `http://example.com/index.php?login=yes&PHPSESSID=9876`.

3. **User Logs In:**
    - The user clicks the link and logs into the website.
    - The website associates the fixed session ID (`9876`) with the user’s authenticated session.

4. **Attacker Takes Over:**
    - Since the attacker knows the session ID (`9876`), they can now access the user’s account.



## **Preventing Session Abuse**

### **Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS)**
- Encrypts session cookies to prevent interception.
- Authenticates the server to prevent proxy-based attacks.
- Essential for securing sensitive information, even on non-financial websites.
- Example attack scenario:
  1. Attacker hijacks a user’s session via an insecure proxy.
  2. Sensitive information is exposed, leading to reputational and legal risks.

### **Use Cookies Instead of `$_GET` Variables**
- Enforce session cookie usage:
  ```php
  ini_set( 'session.use_only_cookies', TRUE );
  ini_set( 'session.use_trans_sid', FALSE );
  ```
- Prevents session ID exposure in URLs.
- Protects against session fixation attacks and back-button issues.

### **Use Session Timeouts**
- Control session lifespan with:
  ```php
  ini_set( 'session.cookie_lifetime', 1200 ); // 20 minutes
  ini_set( 'session.gc_maxlifetime', 1440 );  // 24 minutes
  ```
- Short-lived sessions reduce hijacking risks but may inconvenience users.
- Real-time hijacking via reverse proxies can still occur.

### **Regenerate IDs for Users with Changed Status**
- Generate a new session ID when:
  - Logging in.
  - Moving between secure and insecure areas.
- Prevents reuse of compromised session IDs.
- Example implementation:
  ```php
  if (!empty($_POST['password']) && $_POST['password'] === $password) {
      session_regenerate_id();
      $_SESSION['auth'] = TRUE;
      header('Location: ' . $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);
  }
  ```

### **Take Advantage of Code Abstraction**
- Use PHP’s built-in session management for reliability and security.
- Store session data in a database for scalability across multiple servers.
- Example: Use session ID as a primary key for efficient lookup.

By following these best practices, developers can **significantly reduce the risk of session hijacking and abuse** while ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
