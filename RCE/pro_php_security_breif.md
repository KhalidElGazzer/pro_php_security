# Preventing Remote Execution in PHP Applications

Remote execution attacks aim to take control of an application by exploiting scriptable interfaces, such as template systems or user input passed to shell commands. These attacks are particularly dangerous in PHP applications due to the language's flexibility and power. Below is a summary of the risks and strategies to prevent remote execution attacks.

**How Remote Execution Works**

1. Exploiting Template Systems:

* Template systems replace placeholders with actual values. If PHP's eval() is used, attackers can inject malicious PHP code into user-submitted text, which the template system will execute.

2. User Input in Shell Commands:

* PHP scripts often call command-line programs with user input as arguments. Attackers can craft input to turn a single command into a scripted series of commands, executing malicious actions.

3.Vulnerable PHP Functions:

* PHP functions like `eval()`, `exec()`, `passthru()`, `proc_open()`, `shell_exec()`, and `system()` are common targets for remote execution attacks.

**The Dangers of Remote Execution**
 
PHP's flexibility allows for dynamic script execution and shell command execution, but this power comes with risks:

1. Injection of PHP Code:

* Attackers can inject PHP code through functions like `include()`, `require()`, `eval()`, and `preg_replace()` with the e modifier.

* Example: An attacker can inject PHP code into a template system, leading to unauthorized script execution.

2. Embedding PHP Code in Uploaded Files:

* Attackers can embed PHP code in seemingly harmless files (e.g., images, PDFs). When uploaded and executed, these files can reveal sensitive information or execute malicious commands.

* Example: Appending PHP code to a GIF file (locked.gif) and uploading it as locked.php to execute the embedded code.

3. Injection of Shell Commands:

* Attackers can inject shell metacharacters (e.g., |, ;, &) into user input passed to shell commands, enabling arbitrary command execution.

* Example: Injecting cat /etc/passwd into a script that uses shell_exec() to count words in a file.

# Strategies for Preventing Remote Execution

**1. Limit Allowable Filename Extensions for Uploads:**

* Restrict uploaded files to safe extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png) and reject or rename files with dangerous extensions (e.g., .php, .exe).

* Use an array of allowed extensions and append a safe extension (e.g., .upload) to uploaded files.

**2. Store Uploads Outside the Web Document Root:**

* Store uploaded files outside the web-accessible directory to prevent direct execution by the web server.

* Ensure no world-writable directories exist within the web root.

**3. Validate and Sanitize User Input:**

* Escape or sanitize all user input before using it in shell commands or PHP functions.

* Use functions like `escapeshellarg()` and `escapeshellcmd()` to safely handle shell commands.

**4. Avoid Dangerous PHP Functions:**

* Avoid using `eval()`, `exec()`, `system()`, and similar functions unless absolutely necessary.

* Use safer alternatives for dynamic code execution and shell command handling.

**5. Use Safe Mode and Disable Dangerous Features:**

* Enable PHP's Safe Mode to restrict access to system commands and files.

* Disable dangerous PHP functions in php.ini using the disable_functions directive.

**6. Allow Only Trusted Users to Import Code:**

* Restrict module installation and code import to authenticated administrators.

* Disable administrative interfaces by default and enforce SSL for secure connections.


**7. Convert User-Submitted PHP to Non-Executable Formats:**

* Use `highlight_file()` to convert user-submitted PHP code into non-executable HTML, preventing accidental execution.

**8. Disabling PHP Functions Globally**

Why Disable Functions?

* Functions like `eval()` and `phpinfo()` can be exploited for remote code execution or information disclosure.

Disabling these functions reduces the attack surface of your application.

How to Disable Functions:

Use the `disable_function`s directive in the `php.ini` file.

```
disable_functions = "eval,phpinfo"
```
This directive disables the specified functions globally and cannot be overridden in ```.htaccess``` or via `ini_set()`.

**9. Sanitizing Input for `eval()`:**

Risks of eval():

* `eval()` executes arbitrary PHP code, making it a prime target for remote execution attacks.

* Even with sanitization, `eval()` is inherently risky.

Sanitization Function (safeForEval):

A custom function can sanitize input for eval() by:

* Checking for newline characters (\n), which are often used to separate commands.

* Escaping PHP metacharacters (e.g., $, {, }, [, ], `, ;) using addslashes() and str_replace().

```php
function safeForEval($string) {
$nl = chr(10); // Newline character
if (strpos($string, $nl)) {
   exit("$string is not permitted as input.");
}
$meta = array('$', '{', '}', '[', ']', '`', ';');
$escaped = array('&#36', '&#123', '&#125', '&#91', '&#93', '&#96', '&#59');
$out = addslashes($string); // Escape quotes and backslashes
$out = str_replace($meta, $escaped, $out); // Escape metacharacters
return $out;
}
```

**10. Preventing Remote Execution**

Avoid Including Remote PHP Scripts:

* Including PHP scripts from remote servers (e.g., include('`http://example.com/script.php`')) is dangerous.

* An attacker could spoof the remote server and inject malicious code.

* Use hardcoded IP addresses or avoid remote includes altogether.

Safer Alternatives:

* Use SOAP, XML-RPC, or other secure methods for remote script execution.

* Fetch data from remote servers instead of executing code.

**11. Use functions like `escapeshellarg()` and `escapeshellcmd()` for shell commands.**

`escapeshellarg()` => adds single quotes around a string and escapes any existing **single quotes** within the string using `\`, ensuring that the string is treated as a single argument, even if it contains spaces, semicolons, or other shell metacharacters.

```
it's => becomes => 'it'\''s'
file; rm -rf / => becomes => 'file; rm -rf /'.
```
`escapeshellcmd()` => The function escapes characters like `;, |, &, >, <, (, ), ", ',` and spaces by adding a backslash `\` before them, ensuring that the input is treated as a single command rather than allowing multiple commands to be executed.

```
echo hello; rm -rf / => becomes => echo hello\; rm -rf /
```
